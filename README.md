# aave-wallet-credit-score
This project uses transaction-level data from the Aave V2 protocol to assign a credit score (0â€“1000) to wallets based on their behavior. The model analyzes patterns like deposits, borrows, repayments, liquidations, and redemptions to classify wallets as reliable or risky.
